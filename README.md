# My Dotfiles
This repository contains setup files and scripts for my development as a programmer. Feel free to try them out as you please.  
## .nanorc
This is my custom .nanorc configuration for Nano. After running my scripts it will change your .nanorc in your home directory to my custom version. 
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash. Similarly to the .nanorc, after running the make in your terminal the .bashrc will contain 'source ~/.dotfiles/etc/bashrc_custom
## bin folder
Inside of my bin folder you can find my two linux scripts that will allow you to navigate the linux terminal

My first script - Cleanup, is designed to cleanup various configuration files and directories

My second script - Linux, is designed to manipulate various aspects of the terminal, like allowing the command cdd to change to the previous directory. 

## Makefile

The Makefile is how you will run the scripts in your terminal. Initially clearning your terminal to ensure correct conditons, and then running the linux script to change various aspects of your console.
